# batch-image-converter

It’s a batch image converter that turns PNG files into JPG, WEBP, and AVIF. It’s built on the sharp converter, which itself relies on the libvips library. For instance, the popular Squoosh tool uses the same library.
No frills or extra features here. I made it purely for my own use.
